## 💡 Ideation

### Problem
Freelance music teachers who teach 1:1 lessons usually have students all at different stages of progress. This makes it **tedious for teachers to keep track and plan lessons** for each individual student. Also, most teachers schedule for back-to-back classes during peak periods (after-school hours, weekends). This leaves **insufficient time to communicate with parents or keep proper records of lesson logs** after each lesson, risking delays that will snowball and disrupt the schedule for the remainder of the day. Lastly, as a freelancer, there is also the **administrative hassle of updating schedules, creating invoices and sending payment reminders to parents** which are usually done on separate applications and is inefficient.   

> **Problem Statement:** Freelance music teachers need a way to quickly record lesson progress and communicate it to parents after every lesson to ensure accountability without risking delays between classes. They also need a way to efficiently settle scheduling and invoicing so that they can focus on improving lessons instead.

### Solution
App that allows:
- Creating, editing and deleting lesson logs that can be shared with parents (by teacher)
- Viewing and commenting on lesson logs (by parent)
- Keeping track of lesson dates (by teacher)
- Generating invoices based on lesson dates that can be shared with parents (by teacher)

### User Stories
* Salieri, a music teacher, creates a lesson log detailing contents covered in class and things for the student to work on before the next lesson. He is able to edit and delete this log, as well as share it with the respective parent.
* Johann van Beethoven, a parent, can view each lesson log and leave a comment to acknowledge or ask questions about his child.
